# Call-Center-Operations-Optimization

Call Center Operations Optimization is the process of improving the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction of a call center by refining workflows, managing staffing levels, reducing wait times, and using data-driven strategies to enhance service quality.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Minimize customer wait times and abandonment rates.
- Determine the optimal number of agents to meet service level targets.
- Balance staffing costs with customer experience.
- Compare analytical queueing theory results with discrete-event simulation outcomes.

ðŸš€ Key Features
- Queueing Models (M/M/1, M/M/s): Analytical and simulation-based.
- Poisson Arrivals & Exponential Service Times
- Event-Based Simulation Over 8-Hour Shift
- Customer Wait Time & Queue Tracking
- Dynamic Staffing Optimization (1â€“5 agents)
- Statistical Metrics: Average & 95th percentile wait, abandonment rates.
- Cost Function Analysis: Labor vs. delay cost.

ðŸš€Tools & Tech
- SimPy for discrete-event simulation
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Numpy, Pandas
